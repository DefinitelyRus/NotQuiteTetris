# NotQuiteTetris
## How to Play
> NotQuiteTetris is a simple minigame identical in concept to Block Blast.

You start with an empty 8x8 grid and 4 blocks in your hand.
Each block is made up of 1 to 4 squares.

You select blocks using your number keys (1-4).
You can place blocks from your hand onto the grid as long as they fit.

When you fill a full row or column, it disappears and you get points.
The game ends when you can't place any of the blocks in your hand
or when you reach 5000 points.
